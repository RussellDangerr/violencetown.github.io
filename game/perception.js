// perception.js — who can see what.
//
// The ONE authoritative answer to "can this watcher perceive this tile", shared
// by the chase AI (npc.js) and the threat overlay (renderer.js) so the two can
// never disagree — the disagreement the old READ-ONLY aggro overlay existed to
// avoid. Pure leaf module: imports only utils.js + pathing.js, so it is
// node-testable in isolation the way ai.js / pathing.js / rings.js are.
//
// Three zones, measured from the watcher's facing:
//   cone       ±45°, full sightRange       → DIRECT (spotted)
//   periphery  ±90°, ceil(sightRange / 2)  → PERIPHERAL (accrues suspicion)
//   rear       anything behind             → NONE (blind at any range)
//
// The property the whole design rests on: for ALL EIGHT facings, cardinal and
// diagonal alike, the eight adjacent tiles split identically into 3 cone /
// 2 peripheral / 3 blind. So the entire player-facing rule is "the three tiles
// behind them are the blind spot" — no exceptions to memorise.
//
// Design: plans/stealth-perception-and-thieve.md
