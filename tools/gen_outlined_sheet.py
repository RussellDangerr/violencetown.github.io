"""Bring Kenney's roguelikeSheet objects into Violencetown's house style.

roguelikeSheet_transparent.png (bundled, unregistered) has art the game
badly needs — a dozen distinct gravestone silhouettes, 2x2 circus tents,
interior floor tiles — but every object on it carries a light-grey bevel
highlight and NO dark border, where tinyDungeon and tinyTown (the game's
actual art source) carry a bold near-black outline on everything. Dropped in
raw, this sheet reads flat and looks like a second, foreign art pack — the
same style mismatch that got roguelikeChar rejected outright (see
plans/zone-identity.md, "The style rule this pass establishes").

The ruling (Caelan, 2026-09-07): generate, don't reject. This script
re-outlines the specific cells the game wants and packs them into a new,
gutter-free atlas — the same treatment gen_font / gen_ui_panel /
gen_emote_sheet give other art in this repo.

Source geometry: roguelikeSheet_transparent.png is a 1px-gutter sheet (57x31
cells, stride 17) — source pixel = (col*17, row*17), cell size 16x16. See
sprites.js's SpriteSheet.padding note for why the gutter matters (get it
wrong and deep rows drift up, rendering two half-cells stacked).

Outline: a working prototype confirmed on gravestones 2026-09-07 — flood a
1px stroke of colour (38,26,32,255) onto every transparent pixel 4-adjacent
to an opaque one. Used verbatim below, not rederived.

Edge clipping is real and is measured per cell, not eyeballed (alpha bbox
vs. the 16x16 cell bounds), because a silhouette flush against the cell
edge has no transparent pixel on that side for the outline to occupy:
  - 3 gravestones (archRound / flatTop / notched) fill the FULL cell
    height — top AND bottom both flush, zero margin on that axis. No 1px
    shift can free either side without cropping real silhouette pixels off
    the other, so these are inset by a ~12% shrink instead (16px -> 14px,
    centered, nearest-neighbor): no pixels are cropped, it just
    manufactures the margin an outline needs.
  - 6 gravestones touch the BOTTOM only (the stone's base sits on the
    cell's last row, which is normal for anything standing on the ground).
    These have >=1px of margin on every OTHER side, so they get a lossless
    1px shift toward that margin before outlining — no resampling.
  - 3 gravestones (gothicPeak / wideArch / engravedCross) already clear
    every edge and are outlined as extracted.
  - Both circus tents are authored as 2x2 blocks (4 cells each) that must
    join seamlessly. Outlining each 16x16 quadrant on its own would draw a
    dark cross through the middle of the tent — an internal seam, not a
    real silhouette edge. So each tent is reassembled to its native 32x32
    FIRST, outlined ONCE as a whole (its true outer silhouette turns out to
    be flush top+bottom too, so it takes the same shrink-inset as the
    full-bleed gravestones), and only THEN re-sliced back into four 16x16
    columns for the packed atlas.

Floors are extracted WITHOUT any outline or inset — deliberately. They are
tileable ground, drawn edge-to-edge against their neighbors; an outline
would draw a visible grid across the floor instead of a seamless surface.

Output: game/assets-placeholder/kenney/rlOutlined_packed.png — a single
packed (gutter-free) row of 16x16 cells, so it registers in sprites.js with
padding: 0 (unlike its 1px-gutter source). Re-run and copy the printed
column order into OUTLINED_SPRITES in sprites.js if this list ever changes.
